# Digsim

This repository contains a simple Python 2D side scrolling platformer built with [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/).

## Requirements
- Python 3
- pygame

## Running
```
python platformer.py
```

Use the arrow keys or WASD to move. W or the up arrow jumps, A/left moves left,
S/down moves down and D/right moves right. Left click mines tiles.

Hostile NPCs spawn only in pitch-black underground areas. Click them to attack;
tools deal more damage than bare hands and swords hit hardest. NPC health bars
appear only after they take damage.
